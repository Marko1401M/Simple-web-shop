# Simple web shopp
 A simple webshop that showcases my basic understanding of php
 
# Technologies used:
    PHP, MYSQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

# Functionalities
Posting an advert to the site, deleting it, following someone elses post, sending messages(When you send a message it is sent instantly, but if someone sent u a message while u are in that chat, you will have to refresh the page to load it!), adding friends, following specific seller, searching through adverts, i will add ability to leave a rating to seller. Register/LogIn, changing passwords etc..

# 
For admin GUI i created an app in Java that is also in my other repository. 
I should've made a slightly better file/folder organization.
